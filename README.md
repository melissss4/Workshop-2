# Workshop-2

## Workshop 2:
Current sketch: https://editor.p5js.org/melisssa/full/jTs0vLPzH 

Objective: To have things showing up on screen after the mouse is pressed/ to use the setTimeout and setInterval functions. 


In this code, since I am very new to coding, I wanted to make sure I was able to understand what each bit of code was for, so that I do not get confused with all the unfamiliar script on the screen; to familiarise myself with the functions of the code I made notes next to the different parts of the code, this was also done in preparation for our tasks next week so that anyone would be able to understand the different working parts I have going on. Again, sticking to the star in the night looking sketch I didnâ€™t want to start my code from scratch, so instead I tried to incorporate the etTimeout and setInterval functions into my pre-existing code. To do this I followed the given structure, and adapted it to the pre-existing code, making sure to leave notes in the code as I went along, so that I did not confuse myself. I decided to keep the interval time of 1000ms (one second) so that the stars looked like they were twinkling. If I wanted to make the stars a little slower in repopulating, I could have raised the interval time, but I was happy with where it was at. I think there is probably a way to shorten the code a little bit, as I think the amount of lines I have is a little but too much for the simplistic nature of the sketch, so my focus going into my next sketch would be to try and make the code simpler. I think because I am so new to coding that this will come with time and as I gain more experience.
(note: I have just now been on canvas and seen one of the student exemplars is very similar to mine, I'm not sure if I saw this and stored it subconsciously, but the similarity is not done consciously)
